	Abstract = {Benchmarking is critical when evaluating performance, but is especially difficult for file and storage systems. Complex interactions between I/O devices, caches, kernel daemons, and other OS components result in behavior that is rather difficult to analyze. Moreover, systems have different features and optimizations, so no single benchmark is always suitable. The large variety of workloads that these systems experience in the real world also adds to this difficulty.

In this article we survey 415 file system and storage benchmarks from 106 recent papers. We found that most popular benchmarks are flawed and many research papers do not provide a clear indication of true performance. We provide guidelines that we hope will improve future performance evaluations. To show how some widely used benchmarks can conceal or overemphasize overheads, we conducted a set of experiments. As a specific example, slowing down read operations on ext2 by a factor of 32 resulted in only a 2--5% wall-clock slowdown in a popular compile benchmark. Finally, we discuss future work to improve file system and storage benchmarking.},

	Abstract = {Recently, power has emerged as a critical factor in designing components of storage systems, especially for power-hungry data centers. While there is some research into power-aware storage stack components, there are no systematic studies evaluating each component's impact separately. This paper evaluates the file system's impact on energy consumption and performance. We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and file server. In case of a server node consisting of a single disk, CPU power generally exceeds disk-power consumption. However, file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power. We discovered that default file system options are often suboptimal, and even poor. We show that a carefulmatching of expectedworkloads to file system types and options can improve power-performance efficiency by a factor ranging from 1.05 to 9.4 times.},

	Abstract = {Recently, power has emerged as a critical factor in designing components of storage systems, especially for power-hungry data centers. While there is some research into power-aware storage stack components, there are no systematic studies evaluating each component's impact separately. Various factors like workloads, hardware configurations, and software configurations impact the performance and energy efficiency of the system. This article evaluates the file system's impact on energy consumption and performance. We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and fileserver, on two different hardware configurations. The file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power. We discovered that default file system options are often suboptimal, and even poor. In this article we show that a careful matching of expected workloads and hardware configuration to a single software configuration---the file system---can improve power-performance efficiency by a factor ranging from 1.05 to 9.4 times.},

	Abstract = {Many database users store data on raw or block devices for performance reasons, since file caching and file locking by the file system can be bypassed. However, many database users would prefer to use file systems for the ease of long-term maintenance. To our knowledge, there have not been any major efforts to systematically assess the performance of Linux file systems for database workloads. In this paper, we present our initial performance study on data warehousing systems. We first provide a brief introduction to various Linux file systems, namely Ext2, Ext3, ReiserFS, XFS and JFS. We examine the performance impact of asynchronous I/O, direct I/O, file caching, I/O schedulers, file fragmentation, and database storage methods. We then quantify the performance of these Linux file systems utilizing a well-known data warehousing workload. Finally, system configurations are recommended and future work is suggested.},
